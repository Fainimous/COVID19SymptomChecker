# COVID-19 Symptom Checker


## Description 
A Web App where users can list their symptoms and check to see if they match the symptoms of someone who has contracted COVID-19.  

If they are believed to have COVID-19, the user is provided a list of nearby COVID-19 testing centers.  

Otherwise, the user is provided a list of general practice offices nearby they can choose to go to for treatment. 

The user is also presented the COVID statts for their state, based on their location.


## Usage

On initial page load, select to allow the application to access your location.  

Once permission has been granted, select any and all symptoms you are experincing and select to "Validate"

The application will determine whether you should either go to a COVID testing facility or if you should instead reach out to a nearby primary care physician for treatment.

Also, you will be shown the current COVID-19 statistics for your state based on your location.
